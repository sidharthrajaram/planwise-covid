![cover](cover.png?raw=true "Planwise")

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we go about everyday errands and trips. Along with needing to plan around wait times, distance, and reviews for a location we may want to visit, we now also need to consider how many other people will be there and whether its even a safe establishment to visit. *Planwise helps us plan our trips better.*

### How it works
Planwise searches for the places around you that you want to visit and calculates a **PlanScore** that weighs the Google reviews, current attendance vs usual attendance, visits, and wait times so that locations that are rated highly, have few people currently visit them compared to their usual weekly attendance, and have low waiting times are rated highly. A location's PlanScore changes by the hour to give users the most up-to-date information about whether they should visit an establishment. Furthermore, Planwise also flags common types of places that are prone to promoting the spread of COVID-19, but still allows users to search for them in case they need to visit them for essential work.
